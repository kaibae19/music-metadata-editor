## 🛠️ Development

```bash
# Local development with theme system and Select All
npm install
npm start

# Access at http://localhost:3000
# Theme toggle and Select All work immediately in development
```

### **Theme Development**
The theme system uses CSS custom properties for instant switching:
```css
:root {
    --bg-primary: #1a1a1a;    /* Dark mode */
    --text-primary: #e0e0e0;
}

[data-theme="light"] {
    --bg-primary: #ffffff;    /* Light mode */
    --text-primary: #212529;
}
```

### **Select All Development**
The Select All system includes:
```javascript
// Smart selection filtering
const selectableItems = this.currentItems.filter(item => 
    item.type !== 'parent' && 
    (item.type === 'directory' || item.type === 'file')
);

// State-aware button text
this.selectAllText.textContent = allSelected ? 'Deselect All' : 'Select All';
```
